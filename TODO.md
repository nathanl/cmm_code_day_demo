# TODO

- breadcrumbs all the way up
- totals all the way up the chain
- add db constraints: entry must have a description, duration must be positive
- when stopping timer, flash message: "timer ran from x to y, added z minutes to duration"
- HTML / CSV reports
- user docs
- Prettification :)

## Explain

Nested routes instead of dropdowns because
  - Prevents giant dropdowns
  - Allows user to bookmark their current project, task, etc
  - Breadcrumbs make this not painful - can hop to top easily
