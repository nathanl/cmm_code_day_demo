# TODO

- set up database.yml for postgres
- have sign in/out working
- have one CRUD action working

    You will be developing a web application.  To be prepared, you should arrive with a laptop with a web framework (or equivalent) all set up, with a CRUD application running to make sure you are ready to hit the ground running. For example, read an entry from a database and display in a browser, allow it to be edited from the browser, and store the update. You may also want to think of typical things that should be in a multi-user web application and have the basics set up ahead of time.

    Our project is fairly large and your time will be limited, so I encourage you to only use the tools most familiar to you in order to move quickly and show us your strengths.  Bring what you need to be relaxed and comfortable (headphones, your favorite keyboard, etc.). We will provide an extra monitor and anything else you may need. Also, dress here is casual.
